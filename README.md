# Loan Risk

## Problem:


A bank in India would like to get a better understanding of customers who apply for loans.  

*They would like you to:*
 
 1. Segment the customers into groups of similar customers and report on those groups, and 
 
 2. Create a model that can classify customers into high and low risk groups.  They have provided a database of current customers labeled with whether they are a high or low risk loan candidate.
